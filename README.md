## Introduction

Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship to defend against waves of enemy spaceships. The objective is to shoot down the enemy ships while avoiding their attacks. As the game progresses, the enemies become more numerous and faster, posing a greater challenge to the player.

This implementation of Space Invaders is written in Python using the Pygame library, which provides the necessary tools for creating 2D games. It features player-controlled movement, shooting mechanics, enemy AI, and score tracking.

## Requirements

To run the Space Invaders game, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pygame library

## Installation

To install and run the game, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Pygame**: Install Pygame using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

3. **Download the Code**: Download the Space Invaders Python script from this GitHub repository or clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage

To play the Space Invaders game, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and change the directory to where the Space Invaders code is located.

2. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script `space_invaders.py` by running the following command:

3. **Play the Game**: Follow the on-screen instructions to control the player's spaceship and engage in the gameplay.

## Features

The Space Invaders game offers the following features:

- Player-controlled spaceship movement using arrow keys.
- Shooting mechanics to destroy enemy spaceships.
- Increasing difficulty with each level as enemies become faster and more numerous.
